# About Me

I’m Paul Hermans — a Dutch entrepreneur and software developer with a passion for simplicity, technology, and self-reliance.

After running my own webhosting company for more than twenty years, I sold it in 2024 and took a sabbatical to slow down and explore what truly interests me: from smart energy systems and software architecture to projects around digital independence and off-grid living.

I enjoy building practical things that simply work — whether it’s a home battery setup, a clean software design, or an idea that makes everyday life a bit easier.

This site is my personal space to share occasional thoughts, projects, and ideas that I find worth exploring.
