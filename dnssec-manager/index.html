    <h1>DNSSEC Manager</h1>
    <p>Together with Dylan Bos who did an internship at FOXXL Hosting in 2019 we build a DNSSEC Manager.</p>
    <p>This DNSSEC Manager can be used by DNS administrators to serve as a connection between your PowerDNS nameservers and your domain names. This tool automates the signing of DNS zones with DNSSEC and uploads the signing keys to the domain name registrars.</p>
    <h2>How does DNSSEC Manager work?</h2>
    <p>The application connects with your PowerDNS Authoritative Nameserver via the provided API. On the other hand it connects to your domain name registrars via their API. Then it checks if a domain name can be signed with DNSSEC to provide extra security.</p>
    <p>We open sourced the project in September 2024.</p>
